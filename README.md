# Activity-Tracker
Chrome extension which will track activities that are performed on different tabs.

You can use this extension in two way using .crx file and loading all github files into extension devloper mode.

Installing the Time Tracker Chrome Extension (.crx File):

Step 1: Download Extension File: Obtain the Time Tracker.crx file from the GitHub repository.

Step 2: Launch Chromium-Based Browser: Open a Chromium-based web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Brave.

Step 3: Enable Developer Mode: Access the extensions menu (refer to instructions in the previous section if needed). Locate the "Developer mode" toggle and enable it. This grants permission to install unsigned extensions from local files.

Step 4: Install Extension via Drag-and-Drop: Drag and drop the downloaded Time Tracker.crx file directly into the extensions management window within your browser.

Step 5: Confirmation and Installation: A confirmation dialog might appear, detailing the extension's requested permissions. Review the information carefully. If you agree to proceed, confirm the installation.

Installing the Time Tracker Chrome Extension (Developer Mode):

Step 1: Download Extension Files: Download all the necessary files for the Time Tracker extension from the GitHub repository. These files typically include:
i) manifest.json (defines extension metadata and configuration)
ii) popup.html (HTML structure for the extension's popup window)
iii) popup.js (JavaScript code for the popup window's functionality)
iv) background.js (optional: JavaScript code that runs continuously in the background)
v) Content.js (optional: JavaScript code that interacts with web page content)

Step 2: Organize Downloaded Files: Create a new directory on your computer and gather all the downloaded extension files (including manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js, etc.) within this directory. This organized directory structure is essential for Chrome to recognize the extension properly.
Installation Steps:

Step 3: Launch Chrome Browser: Open the Google Chrome application on your computer.
Access Extensions Menu: There are two methods to navigate to the extensions menu:
i) Extension Icon: Locate the extensions icon (puzzle piece icon) in the top-right corner of the browser window, next to the address bar. Click on this icon.
ii) Menu Navigation: Alternatively, click on the three vertical dots (ellipsis) in the top-right corner of the browser window. From the dropdown menu, select "More tools" followed by "Extensions".

Step 4: Enable Developer Mode: Locate the "Developer mode" toggle switch and turn it on. This grants permission to load unpacked extensions from your local file system.

Step 5: Load Unpacked Extension: Click the "Load unpacked" button.

Step 6: Select Extension Directory: A file browser window will open. Navigate to the directory you created in step 2 (containing all the extension files) and select it.

Step 7: Extension Loaded: Chrome will process and load the extension. You should now see it listed in the extensions management screen.
